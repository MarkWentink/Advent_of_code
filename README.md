# Advent_of_code

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly series of coding challenges, running daily every December. 

Challenges focus on algorithmic thinking and are designed in such a way that brute force is not typically an option.

Puzzle input is generated for each user uniquely to avoid the sharing of solutions. My code solutions are designed to run on any user's input file, not hard-coded to my own.
